## 백준알고리즘 - 15236. Dominos

- 관련된 알고리즘 : .

### 문제

Dominoes are gaming pieces used in numerous tile games. Each domino piece contains two marks. Each mark consists of a number of spots (possibly zero). The number of spots depends on the set size. Each mark in a size N domino set can contain between 0 and N spots, inclusive. Two tiles are considered identical if their marks have the same number of spots, regardless of reading order. For example tile with 2 and 8 spot marks is identical to the tile having 8 and 2 spot marks. A proper domino set contains no duplicate tiles. A complete set of size N contains all possible tiles with N or less spots and no duplicate tiles. For example, the complete set of size 2 contains 6 tiles:

Write a program that will determine the total number of spots on all tiles of a complete size N set.

### 입력

The first and only line of input contains a single integer, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the size of the complete set.

### 출력

The first and only line of output should contain a single integer, total number of spots in a complete size N set.

### 예제 1

```
Input : 2
Output : 12
```

### 예제 2

```
Input : 3
Output : 30
```

### 예제 3

```
Input : 15
Output : 2040
```

### 해결

```python
n = int(input())

count = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(0, i + 1):
        count += 1
        
    result = i * count
    
print(result)
```

### 설명

1. 2일 때

| idx  | range | count (6) |
| ---- | ----- | --------- |
| 0    | 0     | 1         |
| 1    | 1 0   | 2         |
| 2    | 2 1 0 | 3         |

2. 3일 때

| idx  | range   | count (10) |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| 0    | 0       | 1          |
| 1    | 1 0     | 2          |
| 2    | 2 1 0   | 3          |
| 3    | 3 2 1 0 | 4          |

3. idx * count 를 해주면 문제를 해결할 수 있다.
